# xdvdfs

`xdvdfs` is a collection of tools for interacting with XDVDFS/XISO images.

Currently, only read operations are supported.

## xdvdfs-cli

`xdvdfs-cli` is a command line tool for interacting with xiso files.

If cargo is set up correctly in the path, it can be installed with:

```sh
$ cargo install xdvdfs-cli
```

Otherwise, it can be run from the workspace root as the default project.

## xdvdfs-core

`xdvdfs-core` is a library for working with XDVDFS metadata.

A simple example reading a file from a given path is:

```rust
fn read_from_path(xiso: &Path, file_path: &str) -> Box<[u8]> {
    let mut xiso = std::fs::File::open(xiso).unwrap();
    let volume = xdvdfs::read::read_volume(&mut xiso).unwrap();

    let file_dirent = volume.root_table.walk_path(&mut xiso, file_path).unwrap();

    let data = file_dirent.node.dirent.read_data_all(&mut xiso);
    data
}
```

This library supports no_std. Custom block devices can be defined by implementing the traits in `xdvdfs::blockdev`.

Without the `alloc` feature, only basic metadata features are supported. The `alloc` feature enables several utility
functions that require allocation (such as `read_data_all` above.
